### 1. Preparing the repository

You need to put your JMeter project inside the `scenario` folder, inside a folder named after the JMX (without the extension).
Put your CSV file inside the `dataset` folder, child of `scenario`
Put your JMeter modules (include controlers) inside the `module` folder, child of `scenario`

`dataset`and `module`are in `scenario` and not below inside the `<project>` folder because, in some cases, you can have multiple JMeter projects that are sharing the JMeter modules (that's the goal of using modules after all).

*Below a visual representation of the file structure*

```bash
+-- scenario
|   +-- dataset
|   +-- module
|   +-- my-scenario
|       +-- my-scenario.jmx
|       +-- .env
```

### 3. Starting the test

`./start_test.sh -j my-scenario.jmx -n default -c -m -i 20 -r`

Usage :
```sh
   -j <filename.jmx>
   -n <namespace>
   -c flag to split and copy csv if you use csv in your test
   -m flag to copy fragmented jmx present in scenario/project/module if you use include controller and external test fragment
   -i <injectorNumber> to scale slaves pods to the desired number of JMeter injectors
   -r flag to enable report generation at the end of the test
```

**The script will :**

- Delete and create again the JMeter jobs.
- Scale the JMeter slave deployment to the desired number of injectors
- Wait to all the slaves pods to be available. Here, available means that the filesystem is reacheable (liveness probe that cat a file inside the fs)
- If needed will split the CSV locally then copy them inside the slave pods
- If needed will upload the JMeter modules inside the slave pods
- Send the JMX file to each slave pods
- Generate and send a shell script to the slaves pods to download the necessary plugins and launch the JMeter server.
- Send the JMX to the controller 
- Generate a shell script and send it to the controller to wait for all pods to have their JMeter slave port listening (TCP 1099) and launch the performance test.

### 4. Gethering results from the master pod

After the test have been executed, the master pod job is in completed state and then, is deleted by the cleaner cronjob.

To be able to get your result, a jmeter master pod must be in ***running state*** (because the pod is mounting the persistantVolume with the reports inside).

*The master pod default behaviour is to wait until the load_test script is present in the pod*

You can run   

```sh
# If a master pod is not available, create one
kubectl apply -f k8s/jmeter/jmeter-master.yaml
# Wait for the pod is Running, then
kubectl cp -n <namespace> <master-pod-id>:/report/<result> ${PWD}/<local-result-name>
# To copy the content of the report from the pod to your local
```
You can do this for the generated report and the JTL for example.
